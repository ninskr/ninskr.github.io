                <p>
                During my time serving under the Surgeon General of the United States of America, I
                discovered the power of simple and rapidly deployable web apps in solving long-standing problems. I am currently 
                in the middle of a full-stack web developer bootcamp from Coding Temple, where I am learning
                HTMl/CSS, Python, SQL, Flask, Javascript, React and incorporating everything into a fully functioning
                web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                Afterwards, I hope to continue working with clients on a freelance basis to create pieces that 
                collectively combine to the manifestation of their wildest and most creative ideas. 
                </p>
